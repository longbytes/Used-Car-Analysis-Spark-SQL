![GitHub last commit (by committer)](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/longnguyendata/used-car-analysis-spark-sql)

## Project Description
This project aims to utilize Apache Spark SQL queries in the Zeppelin notebook for an in-depth analysis on the sales performance of used cars in Germany and the Czech Republic since 2015.

## Dataset
The original dataset can be downloaded on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirosval/personal-cars-classifieds) or from this direct [download link](https://tinyurl.com/ClassifiedCars). The dataset was scraped from various websites in the Czech Republic and Germany starting from 2015 and covering over a year’s worth of sales data.
- Pros of this dataset: Contains more than 3.5 million rows of data — a rich dataset to analyze.
- Cons of this dataset: Some websites were unstructured, leading to missing or incorrect data. Data needs cleaning and validation before use.
