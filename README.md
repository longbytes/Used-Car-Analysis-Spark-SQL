## Tools Used
* Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
* Google Dataproc
* Apache Hadoop / Apache Hive
* Apache Zeppelin notebook
* Apache Spark SQL

## Dataset
The original dataset can be downloaded on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirosval/personal-cars-classifieds) or from this direct [download link](https://tinyurl.com/ClassifiedCars) or from my [Google Drive](https://tinyurl.com/ClassifiedCars). The dataset was scraped from various websites in the Czech Republic and Germany starting from 2015 and covering over a year’s worth of sales data.
- Pros of this dataset: Contains more than 3.5 million rows of data — a rich dataset to analyze.
- Cons of this dataset: Some websites were unstructured, leading to missing or incorrect data. Data needs cleaning and validation before use.
